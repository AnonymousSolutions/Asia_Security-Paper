abstract = {From its inception in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran has functioned as a traditional state and an exporter of the Islamist revolution, a formula promulgated by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Creating the revolutionary export narrative and calling on Shia Muslims to dominate the Middle East was one thing. Implementing this policy was another, as the regime—hobbled by a weak economy and a devastating war with Iraq—had few resources to spread its influence and take on its enemies. With traditional warfare out of the equation, Iranian leaders decided to mobilize the Shiite minorities to create the Axis of Resistance using tactics that later become known as fourth-generation warfare (4GW). Iran, still subject to overwhelming sanctions led by the United States and facing better armed opponents in Israel and Saudi Arabia, has intensified its proxy warfare in the twenty-first century.}

This qualitative study traces the structural sources of this competition while taking cue from the history. It argues that demise of Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s plunging into civil war, and Arab Spring leading to violent movements in Syria, Libya, Bahrain, and Yemen accentuated Saudi–Iran competition in the region. Study finds that the sources of their rivalry lie at structural level and can be understood by focusing upon their aspiration for the Muslim world leadership, religio-sectarianism, antithetical governance structure, and Iranian nuclear program. }

abstract = {Abstract The Saudi Arabia–China relationship is at a crossroad. Riyadh has been continuously building a strategic economic partnership with Beijing and enhancing its security alliance with Washington. However, the two great powers are increasingly involved in tense power competition. This article applies neoclassical realism in trying to understand how systemic changes and several unit-level factors and their synergies and tensions characterize the Saudi–China relationship. It argues, in neoclassical realist terms, that the systemic factors shape the broad contours and general directions of states' foreign policies, but their real-world effects are mediated by unit-level factors. In this context, rapid foreign policy shifts on the Riyadh side, either those of balancing or bandwagoning, seem unlikely, despite rising systemic pressure; whereas economic pragmatism and hedging will continue to characterize the Saudi–China relations. A dualistic structure—namely, Saudi Arabia's security alliance and American and economic partnership with China—will endure.},

 abstract = {Pakistan, China and Iran are situated in the same region brimming with natural resources, blessed with geographic significance and endowed with massive economic potential. The prospects of trilateral cooperation are bright as apart from being geographically contiguous to one another, their strategic and economic interests also overlap. Economic initiatives of regional connectivity, being channelised mainly by China in this part of the world, are in total collaboration with Pakistan and Iran’s respective economic and foreign policies in the region. The challenges to these initiatives are many as the security situation in this region has always remained harrowing. Terrorism, religious extremism, sectarian clashes and interference of extra-regional actors are only a few challenges that stand in the way of this nexus. The internal challenges of political instability and socio-economic factors can also affect this nexus adversely. However, if the leadership, governments’ policies and public opinion in these three countries remain steadfast in support of this trilateral cooperation, there is no doubt in the future, the success of this nexus, which would change the economic and regional architecture of Asia forever.},

    abstract = "{For years, mounting instability had led many to predict the imminent collapse of Yemen. These forecasts became reality in 2014 as the country spiralled into civil war. The conflict pits an alliance of the Houthis, a northern socio-political movement that had been fighting the central government since 2004, alongside troops loyal to a former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against supporters and allies of the government overthrown by the Houthis in early 2015. The war became regionalized in March 2015 when a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of ten mostly Arab states launched a campaign of air strikes against the Houthis. According to Saudi Arabia, the Houthis are an Iranian proxy; they therefore frame the war as an effort to counter Iranian influence. This article will argue, however, that the Houthis are not Iranian proxies; Tehran's influence in Yemen is marginal. Iran's support for the Houthis has increased in recent years, but it remains low and is far from enough to significantly impact the balance of internal forces in Yemen. Looking ahead, it is unlikely that Iran will emerge as an important player in Yemeni affairs. Iran's interests in Yemen are limited, while the constraints on its ability to project power in the country are unlikely to be lifted. Tehran saw with the rise of the Houthis a low cost opportunity to gain some leverage in Yemen. It is unwilling, however, to invest larger amounts of resources. There is, as a result, only limited potential for Iran to further penetrate Yemen.}",

abstract = {In the second decade of the 21st century, and especially with the rule of its fifth generation of elites, China has taken steps to consolidate its power in the trans-regional arena. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013, expanded in 2017 to include more than 65 countries. By 2021, more than 140 countries signed amemorandum of understanding with China to become a member of the BRI. Although the initiative was initially limited, over time and its acceptance, China’s approach changed and declared it unrestricted (open and public to join). The main question is, what is the position of the Persian Gulf in the China BRI? The present article argues that the Persian Gulf, as an important and strategic region after Southeast Asia, is the most important region for China, using a descriptive-analytical method. Findings show that the Persian Gulf is a strategic region with an important position for China, which imports more than 40 percent of its crude oil from this region. The Persian Gulf, with a population of more than 170 million (market)and an investment destination rich in hydrocarbon resources, is located between Asia, Africa, and Europe and is one of the poles of BRI. In this article, the method of collecting materials is documentary, and the concepts of Mega-regionalism and Quasi-inter-regionalism are considered.},

 abstract = {This article examines Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), previously known as the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) Initiative. It argues that, in the context of South and Southeast Asia, the BRI represents China’s strategic effort to gain predominance in the Asia-Pacific by advancing its influence over countries in the region, overcoming its “Malacca Dilemma,” and gaining access to or establishing new ports with the potential to serve commercial and military purposes. The discussion centers on the implementation of the BRI in two South Asian and two Southeast Asian countries that are among those most closely aligned with China. It demonstrates how China’s BRI-related actions in these countries represent a strategic effort to improve China’s diplomatic, economic, and security interests. Moreover, it includes a review of leading BRI project funding sources to date and potential adjustments moving forward. The discussion closes with a few insights for BRI partner countries as well as recommendations for the United States as it considers a strategic approach to compete with China in the Asia-Pacific.},

The entire stretch includes South China Sea, Indian Ocean region and stretches as far as the Persian Gulf on the one hand and Port of Sudan on the other.The net result is a geographical distribution of bases like the Chinese ‘pearls’, USA ‘diamonds’ and Indian ‘nuggets’, principally reflecting concerns over energy security and secure access to SLOCs by each of the players. This paper would highlight the great game along the maritime domain of China while highlighting the clash of interests with major players in this area as well as Chinese engagements with multitude of players to counter the challenges arising from competitors. How energy requirement and quest for market imbibe China to design maritime strategies will be an important focus of this paper. It is also necessary to make an in-depth study of Chinese maritime strategy as it is going to have a grave impact on world politics. The paper will try to make future projections of the ‘Great Game’ in the maritime stretch of importance to China.},

abstract = { This article examines the geopolitical and economic implications of the Belt and Road Initiative for the Middle East. It locates the BRI within the region’s politics and examines the opportunities that the initiative offers for the region, as well as its inherent risks and challenges. It argues that the BRI is not merely an economic project as framed by Beijing, but that it represents a new stage in China’s engagement with the region, and—if fully implemented—could have wide geopolitical implications. The Middle East has the potential to contribute immensely to China’s sustained growth by addressing its energy security, supporting China’s role as a ‘megatrader’, and, more importantly, driving China’s efforts to become a global maritime power and monetary power by internationalizing the Renminbi (RMB). Thus, the BRI could have wide implications for the Middle East. Far from being a win-win project for all, the BRI will likely benefit some countries in the region more than others. Iran stands ready to benefit most. The BRI will likely increase the strategic importance of the Suez Canal and could potentially undermine the importance of some logistic hubs in the Middle East in favour of other trade hubs in Central Asia. }
